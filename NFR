NFR 
NFRS is the Non-functional requirements of software development that define the quality attributes, constraints, and behaviors of a system rather than specific functionalities. 
When developing Java microservices, addressing NFRs to ensure that the system is robust, scalable, secure, and maintainable. 

Here are some key NFRs to consider:


1. Performance
Response Time: Optimize microservices to provide quick responses.
Throughput: Ensure the system can handle a high number of requests per second.
Latency: Minimize latency in inter-service communication.

2. Security

Authentication and Authorization: Implement robust mechanisms for user authentication and authorization.
Data Encryption: Encrypt data both at rest and in transit.


3. Scalability

Horizontal Scalability: Ensure microservices can scale out by adding more instances.
Load Balancing: Use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across instances.
Auto-scaling: Implement auto-scaling policies to handle varying loads.

4. Availability

High Availability (HA): Design the system to be available even during failures.
Downtime Minimization: Plan for zero or minimal downtime during deployments and maintenance.

5. Maintainability

Code Quality: Follow coding standards and best practices to ensure high code quality.
Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation for developers and users.
Versioning: Implement proper versioning for APIs and services to manage changes.

5. Reliability
Fault Tolerance: Implement mechanisms like retries, circuit breakers, and failovers.
Redundancy: Deploy redundant instances to avoid single points of failure.
Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to issues quickly.

6. Usability

API Design: Design user-friendly and intuitive APIs.
Error Handling: Provide clear and informative error messages.

7. Configurability

External Configuration: Use external configuration management to manage environment-specific settings.
Dynamic Configuration: Enable dynamic configuration updates without redeploying services.

8. Observability

Logging: Implement structured and centralized logging.
Metrics: Collect and expose metrics for performance monitoring.
Tracing: Use distributed tracing to track requests across microservices.
