GET
 
Purpose: Retrieve data from the server.

Design Considerations: 

• Define the resource URL structure.
• Specify query parameters for filtering or sorting data.
• Detail authentication and authorization mechanisms.
• Outline caching strategies.
• Define response format (e.g., JSON, XML) and status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

 
POST
 
Purpose: Create a new resource on the server.

Design Considerations: 

• Define the resource URL where data will be posted.
• Specify request body format and required fields.
• Detail validation logic for incoming data.
• Outline error handling and response codes (e.g., 201 Created, 400 Bad Request).
• Specify how the server will handle duplicates and idempotency, if applicable.

 
PUT
 
Purpose: Update an existing resource or create a resource if it does not exist (idempotent).

Design Considerations: 

• Define the resource URL and path parameters for identifying the resource.
• Specify request body format and fields to be updated.
• Detail idempotency requirements and handling.
• Outline validation and business logic for updates.
• Define response codes (e.g., 200 OK, 204 No Content, 404 Not Found).
 

PATCH
 
Purpose: Partially update an existing resource (non-idempotent).

Design Considerations: 

• Define the resource URL and path parameters.
• Specify request body format, usually including only the fields to be updated.
• Detail how partial updates will be merged with existing data.
• Outline validation logic and error handling.
• Define response codes (e.g., 200 OK, 204 No Content, 404 Not Found).
 
DELETE
 
Purpose: Remove a resource from the server.

Design Considerations: 

• Define the resource URL and path parameters for identifying the resource.
• Specify authentication and authorization checks.
• Outline the handling of cascading deletions, if applicable.
• Define error handling for cases where the resource cannot be deleted.
• Specify response codes (e.g., 200 OK, 204 No Content, 404 Not Found).
 

General Considerations
 
Security: Outline authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Error Handling: Define how errors will be communicated and logged.
Testing: Specify unit and integration testing strategies.
Documentation: Ensure API documentation is clear and comprehensive.
Performance: Consider optimizations for high-load scenarios, such as pagination or rate limiting.

By focusing on these design aspects, the LLD for RESTful web services ensures that the implementation is robust, maintainable, and scalable.



Network Errors: 

Connection Timeouts: When the request takes too long to establish a connection.
Read/Write Timeouts: When the server takes too long to send a response or the client takes too long to send data.
DNS Resolution Failures: When the client's DNS server cannot resolve the domain name of the downstream service.
Connection Refused: When the target server is not accepting connections.
 
HTTP Errors: 

4xx Client Errors: Indicate issues with the request made by the client. 
400 Bad Request: The request is malformed or contains invalid data.
401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required or has failed.
403 Forbidden: The client does not have permission to access the resource.
404 Not Found: The requested resource does not exist.
429 Too Many Requests: The client has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting).
 

5xx Server Errors: Indicate issues on the server side. 

500 Internal Server Error: A generic error indicating a problem on the server.
502 Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request, often due to being overloaded or down for maintenance.
504 Gateway Timeout: The server did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.
 
Application Errors: 
Validation Errors: Data sent to the service does not meet expected criteria.
Business Logic Errors: Errors that arise from business rules being violated.
Resource Conflicts: Attempts to modify resources that conflict with current state, such as version conflicts in data.
